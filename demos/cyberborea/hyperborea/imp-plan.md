# Cyberborea Implementation Plan

- [x] Initialize standalone project scaffold with npm, webpack, and HTTPS cert reuse.
- [x] Port cb.html into modular ES modules (config/utilities/game loop) with Three r181 via npm.
- [x] Wire NodeKernel/relay-config reuse without duplicating the relay server; ensure webpack dev server serves required assets.
- [x] Add `npm run tests` coverage for core utilities and include a build smoke check.
- [x] Document run/test steps alongside the new project layout.
