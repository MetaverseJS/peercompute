Task Completed

# PeerCompute Project Status & Next Steps

## Current Status

__Phase Completed:__ Initial Stubbing ✓

All core modules have been stubbed with:

- Complete JSDoc documentation
- Method signatures and parameters
- TODO markers for implementation
- Proper ES6 module structure

__Current Stack:__

- **Client Build:** Webpack 5 (Replaced Vite)
- **Server Runtime:** Deno (Replaced Node.js)
- **Module System:** ES6 modules
- **P2P Networking:** libp2p v3.1.2 ✅
- **CRDT State Sync:** Yjs + y-libp2p ✅
- **Persistence:** y-indexeddb ✅

## Major Architectural Decisions

### 4. Architecture Migration: Webpack & Deno ✅
**Decision Date:** 2025-11-19

**Browser Client (Webpack 5):**
- Replaced Vite with Webpack 5 to resolve persistent `libp2p` bundling issues.
- Vite stripped essential properties from `noise` crypto module; Webpack handles these Node.js polyfills correctly.
- Added `process`, `buffer`, `crypto-browserify`, `stream-browserify` polyfills.

**Server Infrastructure (Deno):**
- Migrated Relay Server and Root Node infrastructure to Deno.
- Deno provides a modern, secure runtime that closely mimics the browser environment (Web Standards API).
- Relay Server ported to TypeScript (`relay-server.ts`).
- Uses `npm:` specifiers for identical dependency versions as client.

### 1. P2P Networking: Modern libp2p v3.1.2 ✅
**Decision Date:** 2025-11-18

**Rationale:**
- Upgraded from v2.10.0 to v3.1.2 to align with interface versions used by `@libp2p/websockets` and `@libp2p/noise`.
- Resolves `EncryptionFailedError: duplex.sink is not a function`.

**Installed Modules:**
- libp2p v3.1.2 (core)
- @libp2p/webrtc v6.0.10 (browser P2P)
- @libp2p/websockets v10.1.2 (signaling)
- @libp2p/noise v1.0.1 (encryption)
- @libp2p/yamux v8.0.1 (multiplexing)
- @chainsafe/libp2p-gossipsub v14.1.2 (pubsub)
- @libp2p/kad-dht v16.1.2 (DHT)
- @libp2p/bootstrap v12.0.10 (peer discovery)

### 2. CRDT: Yjs + y-libp2p ✅
**Decision Date:** 2025-11-17

**Rationale:**
- `libp2p-crdt-synchronizer` doesn't exist as a package
- Yjs is battle-tested, efficient CRDT library
- `y-libp2p` bridges Yjs to libp2p v2 for automatic P2P sync
- Minimal code required, handles conflict resolution automatically
- See `plan/crdt-libp2p-integration.md` for details

**Installed Modules:**
- yjs v13.6.27 (CRDT)
- y-indexeddb v9.0.12 (offline persistence)
- y-libp2p v0.0.2 (P2P synchronization bridge)

### 3. IPv6 Support: Automatic ✅
**Decision Date:** 2025-11-17

**Status:** Full IPv6 support via WebRTC
- Browser automatically generates IPv4 + IPv6 ICE candidates
- Graceful fallback to IPv4 when needed
- No configuration required
- See `plan/ipv6-support.md` for technical details

## Architecture Summary

The diagrams and code reveal a well-designed architecture:

### Core Structure (from compute-node-block-diagram.png):

1. __NodeKernel__ - Central orchestrator coordinating all managers
2. __StateManager__ - Manages shared data state with worker threads for parallel access
3. __NetworkManager__ - Handles P2P networking with configurable topologies
4. __ComputeManager__ - Dispatches compute tasks to CPU and WebGPU workers
5. __Main Browser Thread__ - Handles input and rendering
6. __DataState__ - Hierarchical data structure stored in IndexedDB, accessed in parallel

### Network Topologies (from p2p-network-topology-examples.png):

1. __Fully Distributed__ - Full mesh network for MMO/procedural world generation
2. __Three Layer Hierarchy__ - Root node with intermediate and leaf nodes for player-hosted games
3. __Dynamic Hierarchical__ - Emergent topology that self-organizes based on network conditions

## Prioritized Next Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Critical Path)

1. __Add libp2p dependencies__

   - Install libp2p core and required transports (WebRTC, WebSockets)
   - Install peer discovery and DHT modules

2. __Implement NetworkManager__ (High Priority)

   - Initialize libp2p node with WebRTC/WebSocket transports
   - Implement peer discovery and connection management
   - Add message routing for different topologies

   - Add SSL/TLS connection security

3. __Implement StateManager__ (High Priority)

   - Design shared state data structure using IndexedDB

- Survival mechanics with animals and combat
- This serves as a comprehensive test of all PeerCompute features

### 🔍 Diagnosed Issues:
1. **Encryption Protocol Negotiation** 🔴 - `EncryptionFailedError: At least one protocol must be specified`.
   - Root cause: Browser build via Vite strips `protocol` property from `noise()`/`plaintext()` objects.
   - Impact: Connection negotiation fails, tests blocked.
   - Status: Diagnosed, requires advanced build configuration fix.

### 🔄 In Progress:
1. **Debug Network Connectivity** - Resolving `signal timed out` error when connecting to local relay.
   - Relay and Client are running compatible stacks (Webpack/Deno, libp2p v3).
   - Initialization succeeds.
   - Handshake fails or times out on localhost.

### ⏳ Immediate Next Steps:
1. ✅ ~~Implement NetworkManager with libp2p v2/v3~~
2. ✅ ~~Implement StateManager with Yjs CRDT~~
3. ✅ ~~Wire managers together in NodeKernel~~
4. ✅ ~~Create minimal P2P connectivity proof-of-concept~~
5. ✅ ~~**Fix Bundling Issue**~~ - Replaced Vite with Webpack 5 + Polyfills.
6. ✅ ~~**Migrate Server**~~ - Ported Relay to Deno.
7. **Fix Connectivity** - Debug WebSocket handshake between Browser and Deno Relay.
8. Verify P2P connectivity with `npm test`.

### ⏳ Future Steps:
1. Evaluate WebAssembly for compute layer (see implementation log)
2. Implement ComputeManager with worker pool
