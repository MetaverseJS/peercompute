# Implementation Status

Updated: 2026-06-06 07:54:23 AKDT

## Current Focus
- ULG magnetar handoff orchestration across PeerCompute, Eshkol, MoonLab, and the ULG demo.

## Completed In This Checkpoint
- Durable ULG handoff envelopes now produce `peercompute.ulg.handoff-service-dispatch-plan.v0`.
- MoonLab quantum-response artifacts dispatch as `moonlab.ulg.quantum-response.ingest`.
- Eshkol closure artifacts dispatch as `eshkol.ulg.closure-artifact.ingest` or descriptor-bind tasks.
- `UlgHandoffServiceHost` can optionally execute dispatches through an injected service executor.
- WorkerSupervisor tests prove envelope, dispatch plan, dispatch result, and artifact-cache storage.

## Verified
- `node --test peercompute/tests/unit/serviceOrchestration.test.js` passed.
- `npm --prefix demos/multiscale run build` passed with the existing large-chunk warning.
- `git diff --check` passed.

## Next
- Wire dispatch plans to real registered Eshkol/MoonLab service hosts instead of the injected test executor.
- Keep scientific-readiness language scoped to reduced calibrated magnetar runtime, not full GRMHD/PIC/radiation transport.
- Keep commits local only.
